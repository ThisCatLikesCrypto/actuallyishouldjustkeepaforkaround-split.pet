Hey there. So a few things have happened recently:

## monofile beta shutdown

To begin with, the official public :monofile: monofile test instance has been [banned by :simple.Glitch: Glitch](https://github.com/mollersuite/monofile/issues/78). I (or we, I guess) have no current plans to resurrect it anytime soon.

The most likely cause is probably a DMCA request. Another potential cause is monofile being essentially DDoS'ed due to the posting of a monofile link on the Fediverse. I've heard of projects getting suspended for reasons like this in the past.

In the future, monofile's beta might be moved to a new host in order to hopefully avoid this in the future. ðŸ™ƒ

## Jellyfin comes back online

I finally remembered to bring it back up. Woohoo. On that note: ever wonder what happened to the split external USB hard drive boot(tm)? That drive is being used here now. Nothing could ever go wrong with this setup. I'm sure :clueless:

## And some other new stuff

I wasted money on a few new :simple.Raspberrypi: Raspberry Pis that will probably be used to run some small things in the future, or just to learn new stuff. Might have a use for [sucks.win](https://sucks.win) now. <small>(Probably not really, but hosting like Libreddit on reddit.sucks.win or something would be funny lmao)</small>

Oh, and I'll probably selfhost my own monofile. Maybe that'll encourage me to work on it more. <small>Not that anyone else really uses it anyway.</small>
