## A little introduction
:wavesmiley: Hi, I'm split! I'm a neurodivergent (diagnosed ADHD) web developer who likes to make stuff <small>(not that i'm any good at it, or that I do it often)</small>. When I do make software, it usually eventually ends up at my friend's development group, [:etcetera:&#x202f;Etcetera](https://cetera.uk).

I started programming at the age of 7, starting off on :simple.Scratch:&#x202f;Scratch, moving onto :simple.Roblox:&#x202f;Roblox, then finally going to :simple.Nodedotjs:&#x202f;Node development. Later on, I learned & switched to :simple.Typescript:&#x202f;TypeScript, and started using :simple.Svelte:&#x202f;Svelte. This website was my first project using :simple.Astro:&#x202f;Astro.

I don't really have many projects. The only notable ones that I've actually really touched recently are [:monofile:&#x202f;monofile](https://github.com/mollersuite/monofile), a stupid little file sharing service built off Discord's CDN (which was actually created before that one YouTube video popped off), as well as this site.

I primarily do my work off my [:simple.Framework:&#x202f;Framework 13](/blog/setup#laptop). I also procrastinate a lot on both my online work and schoolwork (thanks, ADHD!) Oh, and if you're wondering why I have 64GB of RAM, I just really like tabs:

<p align="center"><small>Send help my lap is burning<br />Editor's note: it's actually 3019 tabs now.</small></p>

Uh, other small stuff about me: 
- I'm kinda stupid
- I don't have a great memory; don't expect me to remember stuff you tell me
- I don't really have any hobbies outside of programming

...and that's about it, I guess. I don't have much else to add, so I guess I'll be ending this post here...?
