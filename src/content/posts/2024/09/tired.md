Sorry for not doing much lately. School started and I'm kind of stressed out. Work is piling up quick and I can't keep up. I'll be back to making stuff soon, I just need ideas...

I kind of want to set up an ntfy. That could be fun. Some dumb "ping me" button...

Oh, oh, and post comments, but filtering, validation, etc...

I'm not sure!! I need recommendations. Contact me if you have any, please, please, please!

Post reactions could also be cool, but... I think like, one person would use them?

I was thinking of setting up comments through Cloudflare Email Workers, too - but that's kind of stupid.

I don't know. I'll think more about it later.

i hate mondays

i hope she doesnt try to send me to the mental hospital. im really stressed out because of school and other factors but i think shes overreacting. im not that bad. im fine. im just stressed beecause i fail to do work on time.

is it my fault?

i procrastinated thursday because i wasted my entire break trying to finish one assignment and decided not to do anything at home because of my previous efforts.

i procrastinated friday because i was exhausted and didn't feel like doing anything at all. i had a really bad stomachache after eating dinner so i think that was reasonable.

saturday i was exhausted from socialization. so i procrastinated again.

sunday she was stressed over homework. it stressed me out to the point where i really needed to either vomit or sleep.

today   

today  

today i procrastinated because i got distracted  
i know its natural  
but i really shouldnt  have done that
and i should have  
done my work

but  
to be fair  
i forgot what to do  
for 2 of my classes  
and the instructions werent posted  
so can you still blame me?

probably

why am i even complaining about this

nothing's wrong

i think i should go to sleep

that would  
probably be healthy

she said

she said i was really fucked up.
thats all shes been talking about.
and i dont really get it! i'm fine!
i'm really well off
i'm spoiled
i mean have you seen the setup page
i'm just dumb
and i hate that i'm dumb

she told me i was putting my schoolwork before my health
but if i dont do the schoolwork
my mental health will get worse
so its probabl better
im just stressed out

she tells me im going to die the way things are going
but maybe thats a good thing

im not a good person anyway

whats scary is that she can try to get me there. she can get my name and city. if i slip up she might try.

maybe i do need to care for my mental health better. btu can you blame me? my burnout's finally ending. i can work on stuff again.

but  i don't

i'm so jealous of her

i know handling her is stressing me out. but i feel like making her handle me is too much.

maybe i'm not that bad . but i keep getting told off and people keep worrying about me.

why does it have to be monday?

im probably going to wake up and realize what the fuck i just posted and then immediately delete it. i should do myself a favor and pop open tabs for "git force push" and "git reset" on ddg or some shit idfk

im dumb

why am i worrying about this in something nobody will read

maybe i should just unlist it or delete this file in some random commit lolllllllllll

or maybe i shouldnt commit it at all. but i just want to scream into the void.

tldr. im fine, just stressed and tired. no need to worry.
