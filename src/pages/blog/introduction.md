## A little introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm split! I'm primarily a web developer who likes to make stuff <small>(not that i'm any good at it, or that I do it often)</small>. When I do make software, it usually eventually ends up at my friend's development group, [:etcetera:&thinsp;Etcetera](https://cetera.uk).

I don't really have many projects. The only notable ones that I've actually really touched recently are [:monofile:&thinsp;monofile](https://github.com/mollersuite/monofile), a stupid little file sharing service built off Discord's CDN (which was actually created before that one YouTube video popped off), and this site!
