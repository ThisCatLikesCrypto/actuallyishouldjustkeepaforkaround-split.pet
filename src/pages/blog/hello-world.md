Welcome to my new little site! I didn't feel like the `neofetch` would really cut it anymore, and the fact that it was hosted on my PC meant that it kinda... died if my PC did. [Which it did.](https://github.com/nbitzz/status/issues/686) So, I decided to make a new one from scratch!

I started with just pure HTML, but then realized that pure HTML and CSS *really* wouldn't cut it once I started adding icons <small>and also once I realized CSS native nesting doesn't exist yet in Firefox ESR</small>, so I switched to using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), which ended up working great! 

Originally I was thinking to just have my socials be a little footnote in the corner while all of my projects would be in the background, but eventually decided against it <small>once my dumbass couldn't get it to work properly</small>. Then I thought about having a neat little background to stare at while having my socials just be a little footnote in the corner (until you scrolled, of course). [Too lazy to find one of these proper backgrounds, I just used the Lagtrain MV.](https://5320c414.splitsnewnewwebsite.pages.dev)

Then I thought to [add quotes <small>and Astro</small>...](https://77c727ca.splitsnewnewwebsite.pages.dev/#quotes) and then I thought to [add a blog...](https://3b2aa096.splitsnewnewwebsite.pages.dev/blog) and then, finally, [buttons.](https://65f271c7.splitsnewnewwebsite.pages.dev/#buttons) <small>Speaking of buttons, if you have any, <a href="https://coolviruses.download/@split">please @ me with them on Fedi</a> and I'll add them if they're funny / if I think you're cool!</small>

Aaaaaand that about sums up the development process of my site. <small>Can you tell I can't write a blog post?</small> I still have a few things I should probably do:

- [ ] Add a limit to how far to the right the body can be placed <small>(for people with ultrawide)</small>
- [ ] Replace blog `<img>`s with Astro `<Picture>`s

...but aside from that, I think it's mostly good enough! It's kind of messy behind the scenes as well, but at least it looks kinda nice! <small>Just don't remove the CSS.</small> 

That's probably enough for this blog post. I'm not good at writing or anything, so I'm not sure how many posts I'll make, but I kind of wasted time I should have been dedicating to finishing schoolwork on it, so hopefully enough to make it worth it. 

Uh... bye? <small>jfc i suck at writing long form text</small>
